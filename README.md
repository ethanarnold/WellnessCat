# Wellness Cat:
A cute kitten that hangs out on your taskbar while you work, Wellness Cat keeps you company and reminds you to take care of yourself, reminds you to take care of yourself, and features precisely timed reminders for wellness activities!

# Description:
Wellness Cat reminds the user to drink water or check your posture every once in a while. Clicking on Wellness Cat lets them take a little nap and allows you to see a cute message from your favorite cat. You can also wake up the Wellness Cat at any point or send them away with the exit button (but why would you want to do that?).

# Getting Started:
Run the respective file for your operating system. You can edit the self.x and self.y variables to change the path that Wellness Cat will walk.

# Dependencies:
Python 3.11+, tkinter 3.9+

# Installing:
  -Mac OS:
    -install homebrew 
    -brew install python@3.11
    -brew install python-tk@3.9
  -Windows:
    -download python + tkinter (various ways to do so)

# Executing program:
Due to the different measurements of the computers, there are two versions of this program, one for Windows and one for MacOS. Moreover, the Windows version allows the transparent background for the pet, while MacOs version does not allow the background transparency. This issue is also stated in the Help section. 
Run the program by executing the Python script from the command line or a Python environment. 
Command line example: python pet.py
Make sure that Python and Tkinter are installed in the system.

# Help:
  -Known Issues:
- The variable x and y need to be adjusted for different size of 
screen and os. This is specified in the comment as “# Set initial 
position/display label, you can change these coordinates depending 
on your computer”
- In MacOs, the background color of the pet cannot be set to 
transparent
